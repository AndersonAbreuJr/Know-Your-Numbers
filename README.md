# Know-Your-Numbers

## WHY CREATE NUMBERS:
I am a musician and alot of the times when I play with other musicians there seems to be a barrier on being able to communicate with each other during a gig. The reason being? They do not know the number system. The number system, which is derived from the Major Scale in music, is a common language that musicians use to be able to communicate different notes that are being played during a song.
